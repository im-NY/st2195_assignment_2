Practice Assignment 2
Create a GitHub repository called “st2195_assignment_2” that includes:
1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment [1 point]
2. a folder called “r_csv” with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars (we 
want the table) in the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commaseparated_values and saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV) [4.5
points]
3. a folder called “python_csv” with a Python version of the code in point 2 [4.5
points]
Note that it is advised to use the packages rvest (R) and BeautifulSoup (Python) for 
scaping operations. RSelenium (R) and Selenium (Python) can also be used, but they are
generally more complicated to setup.
Hint: For more information on rvest, you may want to have a look at
https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/harvesting -the-web.html

Additional Notes:
• Task clarifications
o Look for example cars table in CSV format from Wikipedia URL (see below)
 
o Scrape the data and write to a file in CSV format
o Read the CSV file to a data frame to verify that it was correctly saved 

Hints:
• Programming in R
o You may also refer to this video link on YouTube: How to find the XPath to scrape tables in rvest - YouTube
